# Password-Generator
Using functions, arrays and strings, I created a random password generator.

## Description

This is my third project, where i was tasked with creating a random password generator.  The password generator creates a random, secure password for the user.  
The generate button, will send the user a series of prompts and confirms.  Once the user enters the required criteria, a random password will be generated based on the criteria entered.
