Using Bootstrap v4.5.2, I created my first responsive portfolio website!

## Description

This is my second project, where i was tasked with creating my own personal responsive portfolio website.  The pages created were "contact.html", "index.html", and "portfolio.html".  These are all functional/responsive pages that were built using Bootstrap components and grid system, that will display correctly on any device screen that is using Google Chrome as a browser.  A consistent Navbar and Footer was added to each section and semantic html was incorporated into each section of code where applicable.
